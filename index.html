  <h1>Meaning of Github</h1> 
  <p>
    GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development projects using the Git version control
system. It serves as a collaborative platform for developers to work on projects, track changes, and manage code
repositories.

<h2>Importance of GitHub</h2>
<p>

    Version Control: GitHub is built around Git, a distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes
    in their code, collaborate with others seamlessly, and manage different versions of a project. This is crucial for
    maintaining code integrity, tracking bugs, and coordinating development efforts.
    
    Collaboration: GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers. Multiple developers can work on the same project
    concurrently, and GitHub provides tools such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking to streamline
    collaboration. This makes it easier for teams, whether small or large, to work together efficiently.
    
    Open Source Development: GitHub is a central hub for open-source projects. It provides a platform for developers
    worldwide to contribute to projects, report issues, and submit pull requests. The visibility and accessibility of
    open-source projects on GitHub have contributed to the growth of a vibrant and collaborative open-source community.
